# Cross-species phenotype-Disease application
This repo contains data and code for shiny web-based application (https://cell-phenotype.shinyapps.io/cross-species-disease/).

The **Cross-species phenotype-Disease application** enables users to retrieve and explore which mammalian phenotypes and human phenotypes were connected to the human
diseases and which cell types were significantly associated with these phenotypes.
